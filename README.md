reinforcement learning demos
## NarrowDoor
    Use Q-leraning/SARSA/Policy Gradient to train a differental drive robot with only two ultrasonic sensors 
    to go through a narrow door which is just a little wider than the robot.

## Follower
    Use Deep Reinforcement Learning(DQN) to train a differential drive robot with a kinect to follow a worker.
    To speed up training, supervised learning is used.
